    <h1>EasyLogin.js</h1>
    <h2>My personal project aims to develop a JS library to makes it easier for developers to create Login and Register module. This library can let the developers to easily manipulate the position and style of the Login and Register module. Also, the library is going to let the developers to set personalized background picture and Avatar. The login and Register input boxes have features such as it can dynamically check user’s input and the text below the input box is also going to dynamically reminds user whether their input’s fulfill developer’s requirements. For example, if an input box requires an email address then the text below the input box is going to reminds user if their input is a valid email address or not. There are many schemas that the developers can choose in order to restrict user’s input. Also, in order to make sure that user typed their expected password in register page correctly, the module is going to let user to re-enter their password and the module will check if two passwords are the same, if not then it will remind user as well. If user’s input is not valid, then the module is going to prevent user to submit that.</h2>
